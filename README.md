                     <p>The first video covers MATLAB's intelligent calculator feature, basic arithmetic and how to work with code in your beginnings to make sure that commenting code becomes a habit! We will have a look 
                     at MATLAB's data types, special values like the irrational number Pi and the Eulers number e, trigonometric functions and many more interesting features of the MATLAB environment. Duration: X minutes</p></td>

                                          precious work in a so called script. Additionally we will deal with variables and what datatypes MATLAB offers. Duration: X minutes</p></td>
